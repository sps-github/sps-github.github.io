We've learned that HTML and CSS are two of the core technologies for building web pages. They're not only great for developers to know, but also for professions such as Marketing, Copy Writing and more.

**Every single page** that you come across on the world wide web has been created in some version of HTML code! How cool is that? 

Your web browser basically needs HTML to help it know how to present the proper formatting of text and images on the page. Without HTML, your browser won't know how to display the different elements  on the page. This means that HTML acts as the 'bones' of the body and CSS acts as the 'skin' of the body. These are 2 very important elements that we come across every single day as soon as we go online. 

# Why would you use HTML & CSS if you're not a developer?

I've spent over 8 years working in the Marketing field and I can confirm that I had to use HTML and CSS so many times, and so did many other marketeers. Here are some of the examples of the times I needed to use HTML & CSS before I ever started coding: 

**1. When I had to format a blog page or website landing page**

This was really important, especially when I found myself reviewing blogs that somehow had spaces that weren't supposed to be there, images that couldn't settle in the right place and overall layout confusion. I found myself switching to the HTML version and looking for 'breaks' in the code that were causing these issues.... so helpful and time-saving!

**2. When I needed to build and format a company/client/customer Newsletter.**

Anyone sending out newsletters knows that, ideally, the newsletters are not all identical to each other! It's important to keep content and design as fresh and unique as possible, so changing up the colours, layout, imagery and more would really help. In a lot of companies, the marketeer would pass this on to the designer to mock up, but with HTML & CSS basic knowledge (and a bit of creativity) you can do a brilliant job of that yourself. This is really helpful if you work in a smaller company that doesn't have an in-house designer. Plus, you'll feel pretty good after mastering the Newsletter! 

**3. When I needed to make my content easy to read and use**

There were actually many scenarios where I needed our content to be easier on the eyes and more functional. I needed to use HTML to set different headers <h>, change the boldness of words <b> and even change the colour and style of font (CSS). I found myself using <a href> SO many times, this meant that I could create links within the blog post (which were really useful on adding to our overall SEO strategy and our Google rankings... but that's another topic for another day!). 



Overall, HTML and CSS (when compared to other programming languages) are very easy to learn! You don't need a computer science degree and can pick it up with some online research and trial and error. You don't even need to learn the entire language at one go, but you can use it when and where you need to. Whatever your situation, it's the best feeling to just get out there and try to make that web page look great without needing to hire someone to do it for you. You've got this!
