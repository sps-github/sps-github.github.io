In my previous blog, I had explained where my love for the software world began and why I decided to take the leap and learn code. What I didn't mention was that I had been doing a lot of research for the past few years on the different coding languages and what type of software developer I'd like to be. 

The Flatiron Course introduces us to Ruby pretty early on in the curriculum, it's actually the first coding language we're exposed to. **Why?** I dug a litter deeper. 

Firstly, coming across the creator of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto "Matz", gave me some good insight as to why he created it in the first place.

*I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.  *-Yukihiro Matsumoto

He went on to say: 

*Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. **But in fact we need to focus on humans,** on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.*

This really resonated with me. I've always looked at software development as the tools to create something great for people and not just as a language to fix bugs. 

# Which companies use Ruby? 
While looking into software development as a career, I looked into job openings from companies across all sectors to see which coding language they were using and which seemed to be the most relevant at the time. 

I had come across many platforms stating that Ruby was "dying out" and that it wasn't going to be around for much longer. Year after year, these claims kept getting debunked. What was even more interesting were the companies today that use Ruby on Rails as their main programming language, as a significant part of their infrastructure or that started out using Ruby. You might recognise some of them below: 

AirBnb
Couchsurfing
Zendesk
Microsoft
Fiverr
Shopify
Groupon
Kickstarter
Netflix
Hulu
GitHub
Bloomberg
... and many more.

Ruby is commonly used in start-ups and this is mainly because it quickens the overall development process compared to other languages or frameworks!

# Why does Ruby stand out as a langauge?
Firstly, many Ruby programmers claim that it has a **simple syntax**, making it 'beginner friendly'. Sometimes, it can be very similar to reading plain English. 

```
5.even? Will return 'false'
"london".capitalise will produce "London"
["italy", "france", "japan", "america"].sort will give us ["america", "france", "italy", "japan"]
```

There are many other examples which we've come across in our lessons that elaborate on this further. 

Another great thing about Ruby is its **brevity**! 
One of the first things we learned was how "Hello World" and the code needed to return it, which is:

`puts "Hello, World!" `

In Java, we would need to code the following to get the same outcome: 

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

... very different, right?


Another great thing I've learned about Ruby is that it's an **Open Source Language.**

This means that it's open to the public to inspect, enhance and modify! It is free for all to use (not only developers) and there are no licensing fees or other restrictions to the public. Ultimately, Ruby grows organically and is driven by the Ruby community. This means that it is constantly being updated by the community, keeping it technically relevant!

# Is Ruby the only language I'll need?
Short answer is, No, probably not! 

From all the research I've come across, Ruby won't be the end of our programming langauges. The good news is though, that it opens the doors to many other languages and it integrates well with a lot of other technologies. 

The Programming world is one that is continuously evolving, which means that we'll be learning new programs sooner than later! It's also great to know that there are other languages that have been around for decades, which we can pull experience from and having already learned Ruby means that we will find it easier to learn new languages in the future. 

`puts "Thanks for reading. Happy programming everyone!"`
