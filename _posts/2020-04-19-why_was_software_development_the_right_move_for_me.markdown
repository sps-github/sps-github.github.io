Let's go back to 1999, when I was still in school and we had to choose which route to take and which career we wanted to start working towards. Back then, turning the internet on at 6pm was the normal thing to do and you would patiently wait while hearing that 'dial tone', which meant that the modem was doing its best to connect to the world wide web.  

I was so curious about it, about how it all worked. I used to spend ages on the phone with technical support whenever the modem would stop connecting, and would ask them to give me all the technical ways to fix it, even if they thought I was too young or didn't have the knowledge for it. I eventually always managed (which was SO rewarding for me). 

I decided that I wanted to take up Computer Science and couldn't wait for my first class. I remember it vividly, Monday morning around 10am, walked into the classroom and not another girl in sight. We were a class of around 25 students including myself, I was the only female. I thought it was strange that no other girls had joined the class, but didn't think too much of it at that time. 

I had loved the first few lectures, I found it all to be so mentally stimulating and the tests we were given felt more like a game than school work, but it wasn't going to last for too long. The lecturer back in those days felt that the 'boys' were more built for the tech world than the girls, and made it very clear in many of the lectures. At one point I had a friend (girl) that decide to join the course mid-way, she left after 2 lectures stating that it absolutely wasn't for her and that it's more of a 'boys' thing. 

I remember the day that changed everything for me, and that was the final exam of the year. We were all sitting at our computers, when the lecturer gave us the go-ahead to start the exam. I remember it being so much fun and drilled through it at what was (I suppose) a very fast pace. I finished the exam with ample time ahead and submitted it to my lecturer, who asked me to stay seated until the exam was over, which I did gladly. 

The lecturer started correcting the papers of everyone that had submitted their work, while the rest were still working. Everyone had turned in their work with around 15 mins to spare, so the lecturer had managed to correct everyone's exams within the 2 hour slot. 

He took a deep breath in and let out a massive sigh. "For goodness sake everyone! If a GIRL can get an A in an exam, I expect each and every single one of you to have gotten an A. This is unacceptable and embarassing for all of you and especially for me." It turns out that I was the only one to have gotten full marks on my exam, but I was also the only one to have gotten a massive reality check at the state of the tech world at that time. My confidence had taken a hit and I remember feeling somewhat guilty for having made my classmates receive a telling off by the lecturer because of my grades. 

I stupidly quit the course and took up something more 'girly' to fill the space. 

The next 2 decades consisted of taking up Marketing as a career and living in 4 different countries to study and work. I somehow always ended up in the tech sector and was always drawn to the development department. I kept finding myself assigned as the 'go to tech person' if computers were having problems in certain companies, or as the Marketing person who would be called to give their opinion on a new tech feature that the development and product teams were working on.

Eventually, I had even tried to start an IoT company, but after some time realised that even that industry (retail) wasn't for me.

Covid-19 swept the globe and I found myself questioning my next career move, but nothing was exciting anymore and no Marketing job seemed to make me want to stay in the industry anymore. 

I decided to look into Flatiron School. I had come across the software development courses about 4 years ago and always kept an eye on it, wondering how amazing it would be if I just had the courage to leave an industry I had been in for years and follow my dream. 

I took a leap of faith and signed up, got accepted and started a new journey to become a Fullstack Software Developer. Let's see what the rest of 2020/2021 has to offer, with all the uncertainty in the world at the moment there's one thing I'm certain about and it's that I have no idea how this will turn out, but I finally have the excitement back again! 

Good luck to all the other students following their dreams of becoming a software developer, let's do this!
